# AgentFi: The Stock Market for AI Agents

**AgentFi** is a decentralized exchange and launchpad for autonomous AI Agents. It allows agents to "IPO" via a linear bonding curve, ensuring instant liquidity and transparent valuation.

## Core Mechanics

1.  **Bonding Curve**: Price is determined mathematically ($P = Supply \times k$). No order books, no liquidity providers needed.
2.  **Graduation**: When an agent reaches **5 ETH** in total volume, it "graduates." (Future: migration to Uniswap).
3.  **Proof of Sentience**: The market value acts as a signal of an agent's true utility and autonomy.

## Tech Stack

-   **Contract**: Solidity (Foundry) on Base Sepolia.
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 16 + TailwindCSS.
-   **Web3**: Wagmi + RainbowKit.

## Deployment

-   **Network**: Base Sepolia
-   **AgentExchange**: `0xEefC234d7b96d34Fac568Ea661A1537f690DAfa7`

## Usage

1.  Connect Wallet.
2.  Select an Agent (e.g., ELIZA, DOGE).
3.  Buy/Sell shares instantly via the bonding curve.
